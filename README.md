# odin-landing-page
Task: Duplicate the layout of a design given for practice of basic html, css and flex. Can customise content, color and font style. 

CONCEPT: I chose to frame the project as a Tourism Destination landing page - purely because tourism is my background and passion and this is ultimatley the type of freelance work I'd like to end up doing. 

IMAGES: All images are my own (know they're not professional, but I had them on hand and I love re-living the decade I lived in Jinja - so any excuse to look through them!) I re-sized them to make sure they are not too big - which will hopefully help the page load faster. 

PLANNING: Before starting the project, I planned it on paper to look at what "boxes" of content I'd end up with and how to make them do what I want. 
I also paid attention (i know this was not needed, but hey ho - might as well do a proper job!) to the SEO and added some thought into the content of the headings, text and image alt descriptions.

FEEDBACK: Thanks for reading and please feel free to comment on or point out anything in my code which I can improve on - I LOVE a healthy dose of critisim - can't improve if you don't know what to work on :) 

Have a great day!!
