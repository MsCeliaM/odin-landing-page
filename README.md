# odin-landing-page
Duplicate the layout of a design given for practice of basic html, css and flex. Customised content, color and font styles. 

I decided to create a Tourism Destination landing page - purely because this is my background and I think it's important to use a knowledge base if you already have one. 

All images are my own (know they're not professional, but I had them on hand and I love re-living my decade I lived in Jinja, Uganda - so any excuse to look through them!)

I'm hoping that is I bring as much of my own personality as I can to all my projects, it will make future clients feel more connected to me and start building a level of trust. 

Thanks for reading and please feel free to comment on or point out anything in my code which I can improve on - I LOVE a healthy dose of critisim - can't improve if you don't know what to work on :) 

Have a great day!!
